# Youtube Shorts Blocker & Content Filter - Browser Extension

I wanted to learn on YouTube, but I kept getting distracted by Shorts and TMKOC videos. No matter how hard I tried, the algorithm would keep throwing them at me. So I built this extension to block Shorts and filter out videos that waste my time.

## What does it do?
- **Blocks YouTube Shorts everywhere** (homepage, search, channels, recommendations)
- **Lets you filter videos by keywords** (add your own distractions to the list)
- **Shows you how many distractions it blocked**
- **Simple popup UI** â€” nothing fancy, just works

## Who is this for?
- Anyone who wants a cleaner, more focused YouTube
- People tired of endless scrolling and meme/reel/shorts distractions
- Beginners who want to see how a basic extension works


There are probably a hundred extensions like this. I made it as a beginner. It's basic, but it works. And I use it.

## How to use
1. Download or clone this repo
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/` (or `edge://extensions/`)
3. Turn on "Developer mode"
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder
5. Open YouTube and enjoy a cleaner feed

## Collaboration
If you want to improve it, add features- welcome! I'm still learning, so feedback is appreciated.
